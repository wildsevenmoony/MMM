# Moony's Magnificent Modules

## Description
A collection of modules for 3Den and Zeus used by my former unit. You'll find nothing special and a lot of bad spaghetti code!

This mod is usually used by the Mod I'm currently playing in and will have code specific to that Unit. 

## Features
- Selection of new insignias
- Base Medic Module (3den and Zeus)
- Spawn as Wreck Module (3den and Zeus)
- Ambient Animations and Animation Module (3den and Zeus)
- Stationary AI Module (3den and Zeus)
